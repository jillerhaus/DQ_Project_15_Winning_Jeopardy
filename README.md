# DataQuest Project 15: Winning Jeopardy!

This is the 15th project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. The goal of this project was to use statistical analysis to find anomalies in the selection of questions of the show Jeopardy!. This could then be used to make suggestions of which subject matters to focus on while studying for future contestants.

The educational goal of the project was to apply statistical analysis to the questions and their subject matters. Unfortunately this was the lowest quality project in the entire DataQuest catalog and the statistical analysis was very short and not very informative. This project is only on the Github for completeness' sake.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `CSV` file containing data on past questions of the show.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy` and `Pandas`, ` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
