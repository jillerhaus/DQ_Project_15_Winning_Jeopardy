    "## Project Jeopardy:\n",
    "This project was supposed to provide a statistical analysis of the most efficient jeopardy questions to study. The Project was a complete disaster. The instructions were just point by point do this do that and it was never explained why we were doing what we were doing. Furthermore the solutions (provieded in the instructions) were often so moronic (for loop in for loop for something that could easily have been done with vectored standard pandas operations) it hurt to execute them. I provided some of my own solutions to some of the problems, but since the project was so useless, I didn't really write many markdown cells. If you hate yourself, go on and read it. I may go back and re-do this clusterfuck at some point, some distant dark point."
